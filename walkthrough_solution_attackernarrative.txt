CHALLENGE WALKTHROUGH:

PHASE 1: Initial Analysis (Forensics)
Players will open access_logs.csv and search for badge 5547 (the stolen badge).
They'll find 5 DENIED entries at 23:00, confirming the narrative.
This is a DISTRACTION.

PHASE 2: Finding the Anomaly
Smart players will notice badge 9921 (maintenance) has unusual activity:
- 4 scans in rapid succession (8 seconds)
- First 3 return CRC_ERROR with hex data
- 4th scan succeeds

Key insight: Why does a maintenance badge have hex data in error logs?

PHASE 3: Decoding the Side Channel
Convert the hex strings from the three CRC_ERROR entries to ASCII:
- The hex data concatenates to spell out the flag
- This represents a side-channel attack where data is exfiltrated through error logs

Example hex decoding process:
43 54 46 7b 73 37 6f 6c 65 6e 5f 62 69 37 73 5f 69 6e 5f 6d 31 6c 6c 65 72 5f 70 34 72 6b 7d
→ CTF{s7olen_bi7s_in_m1ller_p4rk}

PHASE 4: OSINT Connection
Players check executive_profile.txt and find:
- Marcus Chen runs through Miller Park
- He mentions "my favorite spot" - a Little Free Library
- Instagram photo shows him at library #2847

PHASE 5: Finding the Flag
Players open library_contents.txt (or access simulated web directory)
Check "The Cuckoo's Egg" checkout card
Last entry is the flag: s7olen_bi7s_in_m1ller_p4rk


SOLUTION: CTF{s7olen_bi7s_in_m1ller_p4rk}


ATTACK NARRATIVE:
The attacker:
1. Stole Marcus's badge but couldn't use it (biometrics/photo verification)
2. Cloned a maintenance badge (easier target, less scrutiny)
3. Used the badge reader's error logging as a covert channel
4. Exfiltrated data by intentionally triggering CRC errors with encoded payloads
5. Left a "calling card" in the Little Free Library Marcus frequents
